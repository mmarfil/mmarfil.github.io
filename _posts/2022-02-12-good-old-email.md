In times like these, where everything is so noisy and ephemeral, my appreciation for email as a **communication** medium is nothing but reassuring.

Why? Because it’s dumb, asynchronous, personally crafted, and addressed.

Take a moment to think how special that is.

You may wonder how I’m able to be so positive about emails with so much junk we get, such as promotions, service updates, bills, and spam. 

The reason is rather simple: I don’t eat where I sleep.

Having an account for personal communication and nothing more gives me peace of mind to use it as a communication tool, as designed.

Give it a shot too.
