Along the years I accumulated several small tweaks, customizations, and workarounds I perform to any new Mac and iPhone I own, so I can maintain both my ability to focus, and some level of sanity.

For "Part I", I'm going to address **app windows management** on the Mac. But before that, I should probably start with a quote I once heard:

Multitasking is bullshit. I can't help but roll my eyes whenever someone comes with a fancy talk around the *necessity* of having multiple displays or app windows opened at the same time **and all the time**. 

Surely, one may *eventually* need a couple apps opened side-by-side for taking notes during a Zoom video call, or to move stuff between apps and the like. But other than that? Bullshit!

**OR,** there's also the possibility I'm plain wrong and I suffer from a severe attention span deficit. Hmm…

If you're like me and often struggle to deal with macOS app windows, I may have a couple tips that will likely change the way you use your desktop computer.

### Unitask Team Force

One of the first apps I install to any new Mac is [Hides](https://apps.apple.com/app/hides/id519475454?l=en&mt=12).

This app allows me to switch on and off what they call "Focus Mode". Basically, when triggered on, it will hide all open applications automatically except the one I have active.

Here's a quick demo:

</video>

I've been using this app for a couple years and I can't imagine going back. It's so important to my workflow that I rarely switch it off.

### OCD window sizes

You may have also noticed in the video above I like keeping my windows perfectly centered within the desktop, and at certain sizes.

</video>

In other to achieve that, I use Apple's new Shortcuts app with an actual… shortcut to trigger between 3 window sizes:

- [Resize Window Mini ↗](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/e65d7a27e9f1452392b9e5a20338df0d)
- [Resize Window Compact ↗](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/53b2357d57f94694a756c055349c7e23)
- [Resize Window Full ↗](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/e2a795a9adae4e39bd7b2a6be30fe593)

**A quick disclaimer:** The shortcuts above were made for the M1 iMac 24-inch and MacBook Pro 14-inch. If you'd like to use them, with a little math you can adjust it to work with any display resolutions and sizes you prefer.

To set up a keyboard shortcut, you can click the "Shortcut Details" toolbar button at top right of the shorcut detail view; then check "Use as Quick Action"; and lastly, in the "Run with:" section, type the shortcut you want to use it with. I for one use `⌃` `⌥` `⌘` + the size first letter.

And that's about it — enjoy some tidy windows!
