I joined Twitter _a while_ back. To be more precise, December 2007. But way before that in the early 2000s I had a blog. I’m a dinosaur.

In essence, blogging didn’t change much ever since. And what I like the most about that is it has stayed true to core values. It’s _your_ personal, customizable, focussed space and it’s up to you to set the tone.

For full disclosure, it’s not my first attempt at getting back. I have tried (and failed) a few times, but this one time I got _reasons_.


### Why am I doing this?

- Being concise has never been one of my strengths. I need a platform that is flexible enough and allows me to **break the habit of constraining thoughts** to a certain number of characters.

- I intend to be **a lot less reactive and influenced** by the hot-topic-of-the-day™. Reducing social media usage to some extent is going to give me the opportunity to stay out of topics I have no special talent or interest for, such as politics or who’s getting cancelled today.

- Besides, I'd like to **avoid the [Nosedive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosedive_(Black_Mirror)) pitfalls of social networks**, such as stats, likes and followers counts. In fact, this website has no trackers at all, I can’t even tell if you’re reading this, though you can always [say hi](&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;%6D%61%72%63%65%6C%6F%40%6D%6D%61%72%66%69%6C%2E%63%6F%6D)!

- Lastly, I want to **take back control of my data and online presence**. Everything will be published under this domain going forward.

If you like, you can now get updates via [RSS](http://mmarfil.com/feed.xml) or [JSON](http://mmarfil.com/feed.json) feeds.


See you soon!

_Ps. Even though I don’t want to limit the scope of what I'll be writing about here, topics will surround anything from digital privacy, design, workflows, projects I’m working on to personal notes._{: .small }
