From time to time, I’m going to document what apps made it to my homescreen, why, and what wallpaper I currently have set. For this inaugural post, I have a many apps to highlight since I’ve been doing quite some changes lately.

But before that, I wanted to briefly talk about how my homescreen is structured. Since Apple introduced **Widgets** and the **App Library**, I’ve sticked to this same layout:

- Medium size widget at the very top for Calendar.
- Small size widget at middle-left for Weather.
- Four document-based/finance apps at middle-right.
- Four media consumption/navigation apps at bottom-left.
- Small size widget at bottom-right for [Uno](https://apps.apple.com/app/uno-task/id1534441400).
- Four communication apps in the Dock.

I'm right-handed so early on I decided to place two widgets at the very top and middle-left that I'd barely interact with. And with those zones covered, everything else can be easily reached one-handed.

And that's it—now let’s dive into the actual homescreen and app highlights:

### Ulysses

I used to use Notes app for most of my writing but its rich text formatting can often prove itself problematic depending on what’s the output target.

[Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/) offers solid customization, organization, formatting features and a wide range of exporting options.

### Feedbin

A few days ago I wrote about [bringing (my data) back to the blog](https://mmarfil.com/bringing-back-to-the-blog/) and how I’d approach social media going forward.

[Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/) plays a key role in this change, as it’s a much saner way to read Twitter and RSS. It allows me to filter out tweets or articles I have no interest in or surface what I want to be sure to read.

### Hey

Unlike instant messengers, I have a special relationship with email. I enjoy the crafting, the pacing and how personal it can be. It’s my favorite type of written communication.

I only had the chance to give [Hey](https://hey.com/) a try now that it supports custom domains, and the more I use it the less I can imagine going back. Hey makes dealing with email fun and organized in a (very) opinionated way.

### YouTube

YouTube is a privacy nightmare, and it gives me the creeps I have it on my homescreen (or my phone to begin with).

I subscribe to quite a few video podcasts channels and unfortunately, there are no reasonable options or third-party clients that support 1080p/4K resolution and downloads for offline viewing.

### Karina's Shortcut

At first, I wanted to make a widget for this but due to iOS limitations I just created a homescreen shortcut for it.

Basically, what this shortcut does is to act as some sort of speed dial for calling, messaging, and finding my wife with ease.

### Wallpaper?
