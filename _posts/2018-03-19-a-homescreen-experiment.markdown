Inspired by [this post](http://manuelmoreale.com/phone-setup) by Manuel Moreale, I’ve been experimenting with a new kind of homescreen. One that is less stimulating and make me more conscious of what I really want to do when I unlock my phone.

It's very… empty, yes. And you might wonder: Why would you _do_ that?

Well, have you ever caught yourself picking up the phone without any real purpose, looking for a notification or app icon to tap when you feel bored? I don't know about you, but I'm guilty of that.

Which reminds me, whenever I was bored when I was a kid, I’d either go outside and play with my friends or just, you know, _be_ bored. I believe smartphones are taking away from us this fundamental human condition: boredom.

Anyway, I know app icons were designed to be like shortcuts, but in reality, they’re "dumb", static and don’t show me any relevant information. So the way I found to have my boredom back, is to get everything out of my homescreen (or at least most of it), and then use whatever else the OS has to offer me.

### Today View

Sometimes I wish the Today View was my actual homescreen, I see a lot of wasted opportunity in this—somewhat neglected—feature. There I have everything essential I need to know right now or up next.

I don’t miss the homescreen icons for the Calendar app, or the Weather app or even the Phone app. And for everything else I have Spotlight, which I can simply pull-down and start typing.

### Spotlight

With Spotlight I can pick a password, find a document, search for a contact and email contents or even do math operations. I do that on the Mac all the time, so why not just do the same on my iPhone?

Spotlight is likely one of the most underrated features in iOS, and yet a very powerful one. I suspect many would be surprised of how useful it can be for things you need within your device.

### And that's a wrap

I can't tell if this experiment will stick, but if anything, when I unlock my phone the homescreen no longer says "Tap me", but rather "What are you here for?".
