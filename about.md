I'm an average husband to an amazing wife and proud father of a little princess. We live in Brazil with our two cats in a house full of toys. I'm a sci-fi aficionado and also happen to design [Sketch](https://sketchapp.com/)… in Sketch.

Since 2008, I’ve had the privilege of working with companies such as Paramount Pictures, SproutCore, Acrylic, AppZapper, The Echo Nest, Snowman, SuperMegaUltraGroovy, Vemedio and many others.
