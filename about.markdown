# Olá, I’m Marcelo.

I'm a Design Director at [Sketch](https://sketch.com/) and run a couple other projects on the side, [Slashboard](https://slashboard.app/) and [Uno Task](https://apps.apple.com/app/uno-task/id1534441400) for iOS.

In the past, I’ve had the pleasure of working with numerous independent developers and organizations over the last decade including Paramount Pictures, SproutCore, Acrylic, AppZapper, The Echo Nest, Taptivate, Snowman, SuperMegaUltraGroovy, Vemedio and many others.

Oh yeah, I also happen to be a sci-fi buff, occasional guitar player and privacy advocate.
